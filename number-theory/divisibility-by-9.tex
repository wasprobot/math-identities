\begin{problem*}
    How to show that a number is divisible by $9$?
\end{problem*}

\begin{solution*}
    Let's look at division. When a number $a$ is divided by another
    number $x$ and leaves $b$ as remainder, we can write
    \begin{equation}
        a = n \cdot x + b
    \end{equation}
    
    where $n$ is called the "quotient". But if we just focus on the 
    remainder, we call this relationship \textbf{modular equivalence}
    and write it as $a \equiv b \Mod x$. Now consider another such statement,
    \begin{equation}
        c = m \cdot x + d
    \end{equation}

    or in terms of \textbf{modular equivalence},
    $c \equiv d \Mod x$

    On adding both sides of $(1)$ and $(4)$, we get 
    $(a+c) = (n+m) \cdot x + (b+d)$. It looks like
    when the number $(a+c)$ is divided by $x$, it leaves
    $(b+d)$ as the remainder. This property can be written as
    \begin{equation}
        (a+c) \equiv (b+d) \Mod x
    \end{equation}

    If we multiplied both sides of $(1)$ by a constant number, $k$
    we would see $ak = nk \cdot x + bk$ and again, focussing just on the remainder:
    \begin{equation}
        ak \equiv bk \Mod x
    \end{equation}

    We shall use $(3)$ and $(4)$ as \textbf{properties of modular equivalence}.\\

    Now let's consider all the non-negative powers of $10$
    with respect to divisibility by $9$. We will see that
    \begin{align*}
        1 &\equiv 1 \Mod 9\\
        10 &\equiv 1 \Mod 9\\
        100 &\equiv 1 \Mod 9\\
        10^n &\equiv 1 \Mod 9\\
    \end{align*}

    Multiplying all these modular equivalences by arbitrary
    non-negative constants $a_0, a_1, \dots a_n$ and using
    \textbf{property $(4)$} above:
    \begin{align*}
        1\cdot{a_0} &\equiv a_0 \Mod 9\\
        10\cdot{a_1} &\equiv a_1 \Mod 9\\
        100\cdot{a_2} &\equiv a_2 \Mod 9\\
        10^n\cdot{a_n} &\equiv a_n \Mod 9\\
    \end{align*}

    Adding all these equivalences using \textbf{property $(3)$}:
    \begin{equation*}
        1\cdot{a_0} + 10\cdot{a_1} + 100\cdot{a_2} + \dots + 10^n\cdot{a_n} 
        \equiv
        (a_0 + a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_n) \Mod 9\\
    \end{equation*}

    Well! the left hand side of the above equivalence is nothing
    but a representation of a $(n+1)$-digit number 
    (e.g., $76932 = 
    1\cdot{2} + 10\cdot{3} + 100\cdot{9} + 1000\cdot{6} + 10000\cdot{7}$)
    and the right hand side is just the sum of its digits!\\

    Hence the equivalence statement above shows that 
    \textbf{when dividing a number by $9$ its remainder 
    is the same as that when dividing the sum of its digits}.\\
    
    E.g., $76932$ is divisible by $9$
    since the sum of its digits, $27$ is (and that is because 
    so is the sum of its digits!)
\end{solution*}
