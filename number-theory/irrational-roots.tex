\title{Roots â€“ rational or not}

\begin{conjecture}A natural root of a natural number is either
    an integer or irrational.
\end{conjecture}
\begin{proof}We begin by observing that if a prime number $y$ 
    divides any power of a natural number $x^p$, it also divides 
    $x$ because otherwise it would have to be ``composed" of other
    factors of $x$, which is impossible since $y$ is prime.\\

    Now let $n,k\in\mathbb{N}$ with $k>1$. We will prove 
    that $n^{1/k}$ is either an integer or an irrational number.\\

    $n=1$ is trivial. For $n>1$ let's assume that 
    $n^{1/k}$ is \textbf{rational}, i.e.,
    
    $$n^{1/k} = \frac{p}{q}$$

    with $gcd(p,q) = 1$.\\

    This implies that $p^k = nq^k$ or $n$ divides $p^k$.\\

    \textbf{If $n$ is prime}
    this also implies that $n$ divides $p$ (from the observation made above)
    or that $p=np'$ for some factor $p'$.
    Using this and the fact that $k>1$, the preceeding
    equation can be written as $nq^k = n^2{p'}^2 p^{k-2}$
    or $q^k = n{p'}^2 p^{k-2}$, i.e. $n$ divides $q^k$. 
    But we know this means $n$ divides $q$. Hence we see that
    $p$ and $q$ have a common divisor $n(>1)$. This is a contradiction
    to our assumption that $gcd(p,q)=1$.\\

    \textbf{If $n$ is not prime}
    let $n_a,n_b,n_c\dots$ be all prime factors of $n$
    and $n' = n_a \cdot n_b \cdot n_c\dots$ be their product.
    Since $n$ divides $p^k$ so does $n'$ and so do each of $n_a,n_b,n_c\dots$.
    Again from the observation above, each of $n_a,n_b,n_c\dots$
    also divide $p$, and so does $n'$. In the same way as above
    we can show that now $p$ and $q$ share a common divisor
    $n'(>1)$ which is contrary to the assumption above.\\

    So we see that in all exhaustive cases, $n^{1/k}$ cannot be
    rational. So it must be either an integer or an irrational number.
